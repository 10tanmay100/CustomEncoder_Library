# CustomEncoder_Library
The CustomEncoder is a Python class that provides a scikit-learn compatible implementation of a custom encoder for categorical variables. This encoder can be used within scikit-learn pipelines for preprocessing data, particularly when dealing with categorical features that require mapping to numerical values.
